    <h3 class="nancy-header text-font black">Captain/Marine Biologist & owner - Nancy Black</h3>
    	<p class="text-font black font-size">Nancy Black has a Master's of Marine Science degree from Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (focusing on Pacific White-sided Dolphin and Killer Whales). For over 25 years she has worked with cetaceans in Monterey Bay, including as the primary investigator for the Oceanic Society's whale and dolphin research program. She conducted spotted dolphin research off the Bahamas for six seasons, aerial surveys for marine mammals off California with Cascadia Research, and field research on Alaskan killer whales with the National Marine Mammal Lab for 12 seasons. Nancy has been photo-identifying Monterey Bay killer whales and studying their distribution, natural history, and behavior for 25 years.
    	<br>
    	In the late 1980's when harbor porpoise where being caught and killed in gill nets in Monterey Bay, she collected them off the beaches, documented the net markings and was instrumental in the ban of gill nets in Monterey Bay. She received a prestigious award from Moss Landing Marine Laboratories for this work
    	<br>
    	Nancy also volunteered for many years at the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito where she assisted in the rescue and rehabilitation of marine mammals, particularly seals and sea lions. Nancy also was very involved in the rescue of Humphrey the humpback whale when he was caught in San Francisco Bay.
    	<br>
    	Nancy is an expert on the biology of marine mammals in Monterey Bay and her work on Killer Whales has been part of the BBC's Blue Planet Series, National Geographic specials, and Animal Planet segments. She has co-authored several scientific papers on whales and continues her long-term project on killer whales in Monterey Bay. 
    	<br>
    	She owns a whale watching company in Monterey Bay and enjoys taking people out to show and educate them about the wildlife of Monterey Bay. She has given many lectures over the years to scientific organizations, non-profit groups, schools, museums, aquariums, and the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Symposium
    	<br>

		<h3 class="text-font black">About our company</h3>
			<p class="font-size text-font black">One of the best things to do in Monterey is to join one of the whale watching trips offered year-round by Monterey Bay Whale Watch. These trips allow you to observe the spectacular diversity and abundance of whales and dolphins inhabiting the Bay. Monterey is the best place in the nation to view a variety of marine mammals and seabirds. The Monterey Submarine Canyon approaches close to the shore at Moss Landing, allowing deep water species of whales, dolphins, and seabirds to occur near the coast. Shallow water species, such as the Gray Whale, are found very close to shore in the narrow shelf region.
				<br>
			Depending on the season, whales and dolphins that are frequently observed include Gray Whales, Humpback Whales, Blue Whales, Pacific White-Sided Dolphins, Risso's Dolphins, Northern Right Whale Dolphins, Common Dolphins, Killer Whales, and Dall's Porpoise. We occasionally spot Fin Whales, Minke Whales, Harbor Porpoise, Bottlenose Dolphins, and Beaked Whales.
				<br>
			Our captains have over 20 years of experience with nature trips and offer excellent views of marine wildlife. All our trips are led by marine biologists, most with 10+ years experience, who fully narrate and answer questions during trips. Our whale watching trips are educationally oriented and our biologists collect valuable data on the marine mammals sighted during these trips, including distribution, relative abundance, and behavior of whales and dolphins. We also photo-identify individual whales and dolphins, contributing to assessments of population, residency patterns, and migration or movement patterns.
			<br>
			We are unique in that we are the only whale watching group that has marine biologists on all trips, offers trips in Monterey Bay on a regular basis, schedules trip lengths depending on the season to allow enough time to watch whales and other marine life, and has the most skilled captains who know where to find whales and how to approach them. There is a world of difference between our quality trips and shorter trips offered by others, providing merely a quick glimpse of a whale with no information. That's why we are considered the best of the whale watches in Monterey Bay!

			<p class="text-font font-size black">Our marine biologists collect valuable data on the marine mammals sighted during our whale watch trips. This data collection contributes to our understanding of the behavior, ecology, distribution, and relative abundance of each species. In addition, select species of whales and dolphins are photo-identified by distinct natural markings, which provides researchers with information on movements, residency patterns, population estimates, association patterns, and life history parameters. Photo-identification work is focused on Humpback Whales, Blue Whales, Killer Whales, Pacific White-Sided Dolphins, and Risso's Dolphins.
				<br>
				Photo-identifications of Humpback Whales and Blue Whales are contributed to 
				<a href="http://www.cascadiaresearch.org/">Cascadia Research Collective</a>	
				, a non-profit research group based in Olympia, WA. Cascadia holds the catalogs for the California populations of Humpback Whales and Blue Whales. Through this photo-identification work, they have estimated the populations of these whales for California. Both of these whale species are endangered and this research is critical to determine population trends and indications of possible recovery.
				<br>
				We hold the Killer Whale catalog for California and continue to photo-identify all Killer Whales we see in Monterey Bay as well as document their predatory behavior and social structure.
				<br>
				We also have compiled catalogs of individually distinct Pacific White-Sided Dolphins and Risso's Dolphins, and we continue to photo-identify each species.
				<br>
				The information collected on these trips is combined with our Oceanic Society research project on whales and dolphins in Monterey Bay.

		<h3 class=" about-monterey-header text-font black">About Monterey Bay</h3>
			<p class="text-font font-size black">
				Located along the central California coast, Monterey Bay contains the largest and deepest submarine canyon in North America and it's one of the few canyons that bisects the coastline so close to shore. This allows deep water species of marine mammals and seabirds to be found relatively near shore and accessible for day whale watches. This region is extremely productive and rich biologically due to coastal upwelling and bathymetric features. Monterey Bay's continental shelf and submarine canyon support a variety of habitats with one of the highest diversities of marine mammals in the world. Twenty-six species of marine mammals have been observed here, including five species of seals and sea lions, the southern sea otter and 94 species of seabirds.
				<br>
				The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary is the largest United States National Marine Sanctuary, encompassing 5,312 square miles extending from the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary in the north to San Simeon, south of Big Sur. This extremely rich area centers around the Monterey Submarine Canyon, comparable in size and shape to the Grand Canyon. The canyon extends over 50 miles offshore, reaching depths near 12,000 feet.
				<br>
				The central California coast is one of only five major upwelling regions in the world. Upwelling is a phenomenon where cold nutrient-rich water is driven to the surface due to wind, the angle of the coastline, and the rotation of the earth. This cold deep water is filled with nutrients, and during the spring when the northwest winds blow, this rich water is brought to the surface and with fuel from the sun creates surface plankton blooms. This plankton forms the basis of the food chain for all marine animals. Whales, dolphins, and seabirds concentrate in the waters of central California including Monterey Bay to feed on an abundance of krill, fish, and squid supported by these intense plankton blooms.
				<br>
				Monterey Bay contains a shallow nearshore shelf that is bisected by the Monterey Submarine Canyon. Dense kelp beds grow nearshore over the rocky bottom areas. These varying areas create a diversity of habitats for marine animals. Gray Whales migrate within three miles of the coastline. Sea Otters and Harbor Seals rest and feed within the kelp forest. Harbor Porpoise and Bottlenose Dolphins occur year-round in the shallow sandy shelf region. Minke Whales feed nearshore on juvenile rockfish and other schooling fish over shallow rocky bottom regions. Humpback Whales, Blue Whales, Fin Whales, Killer Whales, Pacific White-sided Dolphins, Risso's Dolphins, Northern Right Whale Dolphins, Common Dolphins, and Dall's Porpoise occur near the canyon edge and beyond into deep water regions. Many seabird species migrate here by the millions to feed on the Bay's rich food sources.
